- Most motherboards support dual-channel RAM
- This provides better performance than single-channel
- Requires installing RAM in specific slots

##### Slot Configuration:
- 2-slot motherboards: Use both slots
- 4-slot motherboards: Use slots 2 and 4 (counting from CPU)
  * Some boards use A2 and B2 designation
  * Check motherboard manual for correct configuration

#### Procedure:

1. **Identify correct slots**
   - Check motherboard manual for dual-channel configuration
   - Usually slots 2 and 4 (second and fourth from CPU)
   - Slots may be color-coded (matching colors = dual-channel pair)

2. **Prepare the slots**
   - Open the retention clips on both ends of RAM slot
   - Push clips outward until they're in open position
   - Some boards have clips on one end only

3. **Orient the RAM**
   - Locate the notch on the bottom of the RAM stick
   - Match notch position with slot key (raised section in slot)
   - RAM only fits one way - don't force it

4. **Install first RAM stick**
   - Hold RAM by the edges (avoid touching contacts or chips)
   - Align notch with slot key
   - Position RAM above slot at slight angle
   - Press down firmly and evenly on both ends
   - Push straight down until clips snap into place
   - You'll hear a click when properly seated
   - Both clips should automatically close

5. **Install second RAM stick**
   - Repeat process for second stick in the paired slot
   - Ensure both sticks are from the same kit if possible
   - Press down evenly until clips engage

6. **Verify installation**
   - Both retention clips should be fully closed
   - RAM sticks should be level and fully seated
   - No gap between RAM and slot
   - Gold contacts should not be visible

#### RAM Speed and XMP/DOCP:
- RAM runs at default JEDEC speed initially (usually 2133MHz or 2666MHz)
- To run at rated speed (e.g., 3200MHz, 3600MHz):
  * Enable XMP (Intel) or DOCP/EOCP (AMD) in BIOS
  * This is done after first boot (see BIOS Setup section)

#### Troubleshooting:
- **RAM not fully seated:** Press down harder until clips engage
- **Won't fit:** Check orientation - notch must align with slot key
- **One clip won't close:** RAM not fully seated on that side
- **System won't boot:** Try one stick at a time to test

#### Common Mistakes:
- Installing in wrong slots (not using dual-channel configuration)
- Not pressing down hard enough
- Installing RAM backwards
- Mixing RAM from different kits (can cause instability)
